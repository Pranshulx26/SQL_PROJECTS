# Improving Profitability through Enhanced Occupancy Rate Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing profitability in air transportation by analyzing aircraft occupancy rates. By leveraging SQL-based analysis, we aim to identify strategies to improve seat occupancy, optimize pricing strategies, and ultimately increase revenue per flight. The insights derived from this analysis are designed to assist airline companies in making data-driven decisions to enhance their operational efficiency and profitability.

## Objectives

1. **Occupancy Rate Analysis**: Examine the current occupancy rates of different aircraft types and identify opportunities for improvement.
2. **Revenue Optimization**: Analyze revenue per flight and ticket pricing strategies to identify ways to maximize profitability.
3. **Pricing Strategies**: Develop and test strategies for adjusting pricing to increase seat occupancy and revenue.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes a dataset from the companyâ€™s database, focusing on:

- **Flight Occupancy Rates**: Information about seat occupancy for different aircraft types.
- **Ticket Bookings**: Data on ticket bookings, including the number of tickets sold and revenue generated.
- **Pricing Strategies**: Details on pricing for different flight classes and times.

### Key Fields

- `flight_id`: Unique identifier for each flight.
- `aircraft_type`: Type of the aircraft used for the flight.
- `occupancy_rate`: Percentage of seats occupied.
- `revenue`: Total revenue generated from ticket sales.
- `ticket_price`: Price of tickets for different flight classes.

## Project Structure

- `Airlines_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the SQL-based analysis, including data preparation, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Analysis_report.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with detailed reports and visualizations derived from the analysis.
- `Datasets/`: Folder containing datasets used in the analysis.
- `report_images/`: Folder containing images and visualizations used in the report.

## Key Skills and Techniques

- **SQL Data Analysis**: Performing complex queries to analyze flight and revenue data.
- **Revenue Optimization**: Identifying strategies to increase revenue through improved occupancy rates and pricing.
- **Pricing Strategy Development**: Analyzing and developing strategies for optimal pricing.

## Analysis and Findings

### 1. Occupancy Rate Analysis
- Analyzed current occupancy rates of various aircraft types.
- Identified patterns and trends in seat occupancy.

### 2. Revenue Optimization
