    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Obstacles\n",
    "1. **Stricter environmental regulations:** The airline industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also restrict the potential for expansion.\n",
    "2. **Higher flight taxes:** Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft as a means to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. This increase in flight taxes has raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.\n",
    "3. **Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs:** The aviation sector is experiencing a scarcity of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and an increase in turnover rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "To analyze the company's database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat. This analysis will help the company to mitigate the impact of the key obstacles and enhance overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Analysis\n",
    "The basic analysis of data provides insights into the number of planes with more than 100 seats, how the number of tickets booked and total amount earned changed over time, and the average fare for each aircraft with different fare conditions. These findings will be useful in developing strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft.\n",

    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b>Table 1: Aircraft with more than 100 seats</b>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain a deeper understanding of the trend of ticket bookings and revenue earned through those bookings, we have utilized a line chart visualization. Upon analysis of the chart, we observe that the number of tickets booked exhibits a gradual increase from June 22nd to July 7th, followed by a relatively stable pattern from July 8th until August, with a noticeable peak in ticket bookings where the highest number of tickets were booked on a single day. It is important to note that the revenue earned by the company from these bookings is closely tied to the number of tickets booked. Therefore, we can see a similar trend in the total revenue earned by the company throughout the analyzed time period. These findings suggest that further exploration of the factors contributing to the peak in ticket bookings may be beneficial for increasing overall revenue and optimizing operational strategies.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to generate a bar graph to graphically compare the data after we completed the computations for the average costs associated with different fare conditions for each aircraft. The graph (Figure 3) shows data for three types of fares: business, economy, and comfort. It is worth mentioning that the comfort class is available on only one aircraft, the 773. The CN1 and CR2 planes, on the other hand, only provide the economy class. When different pricing conditions within each aircraft are compared, the charges for business class are consistently greater than those for economy class. This trend may be seen across all planes, regardless of fare conditions.\n",

    "## Analyzing Occupancy Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines must thoroughly analyze their revenue streams in order to maximize profitability. The overall income per year and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft are important metrics to consider. Airlines may use this information to determine which aircraft types and itineraries generate the most income and alter their operations appropriately. This research can also assist in identifying opportunities for pricing optimization and allocating resources to more profitable routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"report_images/avg_rev_per_ticket.png\" alt=\"Table 2: Total Revenue, Total Tickets, and Average Revenue per Ticket\">\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b>Table 2: Total Revenue, Total Tickets, and Average Revenue per Ticket</b>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure shows the total revenue, total tickets, and average revenue made per ticket for each aircraft. The aircraft with the highest total revenue is SU9 and from Figure 3, it can be seen that the price of the business class and economy class is the lowest in this aircraft. This can be the reason that most people bought this aircraft's ticket as its cost is less compared to others. The aircraft with the least total revenue is CN1, and the possible reason behind this is it only offers economy class with a very low price, which might be due to its poor conditions or fewer facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average occupancy per aircraft is another critical number to consider. Airlines may measure how successfully they fill their seats and discover chances to boost occupancy rates by using this metric. Higher occupancy rates can help airlines increase revenue and profitability while lowering operational expenses associated with vacant seats. Pricing strategy, airline schedules, and customer satisfaction are all factors that might influence occupancy rates. The below figure shows the average booked seats from the total number of seats for each aircraft. The occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the booked seats by the total number of seats. Higher occupancy rate means the aircraft seats are more booked and only a few seats are left unbooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"report_images/occupancy_rate.png\" alt=\"Table 3: Occupancy Rate\">\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b>Table 3: Occupancy Rate</b>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines can assess how much their total yearly turnover could improve by providing all aircraft a 10% higher occupancy rate to further examine the possible benefits of raising occupancy rates. This research can assist airlines in determining the financial impact of boosting occupancy rates and if it is a realistic strategy. Airlines may enhance occupancy rates and revenue while delivering greater value and service to consumers by optimizing pricing tactics and other operational considerations. The below figure shows how the total revenue increased after increasing the occupancy rate by 10% and it gives the result that it will increase gradually so airlines should be more focused on the pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"report_images/increase_amount.png\" alt=\"Table 4: Increased Revenue with 10% Higher Occupancy Rate\">\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b>Table 4: Increased Revenue with 10% Higher Occupancy Rate</b>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is critical for airlines seeking to maximize profitability. Airlines can find areas for improvement and modify their pricing and route plans as a result of assessing these indicators. A greater occupancy rate is one important feature that can enhance profitability since it allows airlines to maximize revenue while minimizing costs associated with vacant seats. The airline should revise the price for each aircraft as the lower price and high price is also the factor that people are not buying tickets from those aircraft. They should decide the reasonable price according to the condition and facility of the aircraft and it should not be very cheap or high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price of consumer happiness or safety. Airlines must strike a balance between the necessity for profit and the significance of delivering high-quality service and upholding safety regulations. Airlines may achieve long-term success in a highly competitive business by adopting a data-driven strategy to revenue analysis and optimization.\n"
