# Classic American Names Analysis

## Overview

This project delves into the evolution of American baby names from 1920 to 2020. By analyzing data provided by the United States Social Security Administration, we explore trends in name popularity, identify names that have remained popular over the decades, and uncover shifts in naming preferences. This analysis is valuable for understanding long-term trends in baby naming and can offer insights relevant to businesses and researchers alike.

## Objectives

1. **Trend Analysis**: Examine how American baby name preferences have changed over time.
2. **Timeless Names**: Identify names that have maintained popularity across the years.
3. **Recent Trends**: Analyze recent naming trends and their implications.
