# Data Analysis Projects

## 1. Classic American Names Analysis

![Baby Names](images/baby_names.jpg)

### Overview
How have American baby name tastes changed since 1920? Which names have remained popular for over 100 years, and how do those names compare to more recent top baby names? These are considerations for many new parents, but the skills we'll practice while answering these queries are broadly applicable. Understanding trends and popularity is crucial not just for new parents, but also for businesses.

### Dataset
We'll be working with data provided by the United States Social Security Administration, which lists first names along with the number and sex of babies they were given to in each year. The dataset spans 101 years, from 1920 through 2020. We've limited the dataset to first names given to over 5,000 American babies in a given year for processing speed.
